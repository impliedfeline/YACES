# YACES
Yet Another Component Entity System, or YACES for short, is a component-based entity system for MonoGame/XNA.

The project aims to provide a property-centric game object-model for the MonoGame/XNA framework, and a game object-runtime which provides an interface for decoration with scenes, which compose of game objects and systems, which provide a mechanism, in association with the runtime, for handling the updating of game objects. To this end, the library will aim to provide base classes for creation of user defined components, game objects, systems and scenes. Certain predefined components and systems such as Transform, Controller and InputPollSystem for ubiquitous game features will be included aswell.

Included is a simple demo of the game Pong showcasing the API calls.
